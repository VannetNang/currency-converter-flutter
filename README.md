# 🚀 Flutter Overview  

Flutter is a **cross-platform framework** created by **Google** for building **mobile, web, and desktop** apps from a **single codebase**.  

---

## ✨ Why Flutter?  
- 📱 **Single Codebase** – Write once, deploy on iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop.  
- ⚡ **Hot Reload** – See changes instantly without restarting the app.  
- 🎨 **Beautiful UIs** – Pre-designed widgets for highly customizable interfaces.  
- 🚀 **High Performance** – Compiles into native code for smooth performance.

## 🔗 Connecting to Data & Backends  

Flutter apps can easily integrate with different backends for **dynamic and interactive** features:  

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| 🌐 **APIs** | Fetch & send data with RESTful APIs using HTTP. |
| 🔥 **Firebase** | Real-time database, authentication, cloud functions. |
| 💾 **Local Databases** | Use SQLite or local storage for on-device data. |

## 🏗 Flutter Architecture  

Flutter is built on **three core layers**:  

+-------------------+
| Framework (UI) | → Widgets, animations, rendering system
+-------------------+
| Engine (C++) | → Rendering (Skia), text layout, low-level support
+-------------------+
| Embedder | → Platform-specific integration (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)
+-------------------+

This layered architecture ensures **flexibility** and **performance** across platforms.
